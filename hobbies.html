                            <div>I workout 4 to 6 times a week, depending on how busy I am that week. Weight lifting trains me to be more self-disciplined and helps me release stress when I feel pressured by school work. Working out is my form of physical and emotional therapy. You can find my workout routine <a href="workout.html" style = "color:yellow;">here</a>. Hit me up if you also lift.</div>

                        <div>Stuck at home with nothing to do? Playing games is the best way to pass time, whether you play alone or with friends. I personally love to play with friends with the mic and headphones plugged in. I mainly play PC games but I also have a Nintendo Switch. Games I play include Apex Legends, Breath of the Wild, Super Smash Bros, and PUBG. Hit me up if you play PUBG/Apex maybe we can squad up.</div>

                      <div>I love to watch TV shows. I watch a lot of reality shows from mainland China, such as Running Man, as well as American TV series and movies. Recently I've been watching a lot of Marvel TV series (I only watched the movies before 2018 - don't roast me the shows are actually really good). I'm very excited for Avengers Endgame. If you're also a big fan of Marvel, you should add me on social media and we can talk more!</div>

                      <div>While I don't have any impressive projects to show off to, that doesn't imply that I don't spend my own time to learn programming outside of class. In fact, half of the stuff I know about programming are learned outside of class. I am actively looking for new opportunities to learn new things in the Computer Science field. In February 2019, I went to my first hackathon with friends and I learned how to use React, Node.js and Docker during the hack. I am also currently looking for internship opportunities for Summer 2019. Reach out to me if you wanna talk CS!</div>
